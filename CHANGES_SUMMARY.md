# Summary of Changes Made

## 1. Fixed README.md Diagram
- Replaced ASCII diagram with Mermaid diagram
- Corrected data flow to show Streamwall connecting directly to StreamSource API
- Shows livesheet-checker as a background worker, not as a connection between StreamSource and Streamwall

## 2. Updated Repository URLs
- Changed all references from `sayhiben/streamwall.git` to `sayhiben/streamwall-project.git`
- Updated in:
  - README.md
  - CONTRIBUTING.md
  - docs/DEPLOYMENT.md
- Note: Repository will eventually move to `streamwall/streamwall-suite`

## 3. Simplified Deployment Documentation
- Removed Kubernetes, Heroku, Railway, AWS ECS deployment options
- Kept only Docker Compose and DigitalOcean deployment methods
- Streamlined deployment instructions with clear, simple steps
- Reduced docs/DEPLOYMENT.md from 576 lines to 269 lines

## 4. Created Simple Setup with Working Defaults
- Updated .env.example with working defaults for development
- Modified setup-ecosystem.sh to auto-generate secure keys
- Database password defaults to `streamsource_password` (works out of the box)
- Made optional configurations clearly marked
- Setup now requires minimal to no configuration for local development

## Key Improvements:
- **Zero-config development**: Run `./setup-ecosystem.sh` and `docker-compose up -d` to start
- **Clear architecture**: Mermaid diagram shows correct service relationships
- **Focused deployment**: Only documented the most practical deployment methods
- **Consistent repository references**: All point to the correct GitHub location
